# Rextra - A docs template for Remix

The idea of this project is to build something similar to Nextra for Remix.

This is a work in progress and has no expected date for release.

## Features

- [ ] Pretty and accessible user interface out of the box
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] i18n
- [ ] Search through documentation with something like Algolia
- [ ] Render content in Markdown (.md, .mdx)
- [ ] Built-in components like Callout, Tabs, and more
- [ ] Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Others?

## Installation

I don't know yet how you will use this project

My options are:

- Create a Remix Stack
- Publish a package to npm
- A Vite plugin? ðŸ¤”

## Usage

Once the project is done I'll create a documentation site using this template to document how to use this.
